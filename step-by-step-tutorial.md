# Step-by-Step Tutorial: Python IAM Policy Validation with Amazon Q Developer and AWS Access Analyzer API

## The Core Problem
**"Generate IAM policies with Amazon Q Developer, but how do I know they actually work as intended and follow least privilege before deployment?"**

This tutorial focuses on building a Python-based policy validation system that integrates with AWS Access Analyzer API to catch policy issues before they reach production.
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Node.js 18+ installed
- AWS CDK CLI installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Amazon Q Developer extension in your IDE

## Tutorial Overview
This tutorial will guide you through building a secure task management system using Amazon Q Developer, with proper IAM policy validation at each step.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture Design

### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create a project structure for a serverless task manager with these requirements:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: AWS Lambda with Node.js
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK
- Database: DynamoDB
- Auth: Amazon Cognito
- Storage: S3 for attachments
Include package.json files and basic folder structure.
```

### Step 2: Define User Roles and Permissions
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Design a role-based access control system for a task manager with:
- Admin: Full CRUD on all tasks, user management, delete any task
- Contributor: Create/edit own tasks, view assigned tasks, upload attachments
- Viewer: Read-only access to assigned tasks only
Create TypeScript interfaces for User, Task, and Permission models.
```

## Phase 2: Infrastructure with Security-First Approach

### Step 3: CDK Stack with Least Privilege IAM
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create an AWS CDK stack for a task manager with:
- DynamoDB tables for tasks and user profiles
- Lambda functions with minimal IAM permissions
- API Gateway with custom authorizer
- Cognito User Pool with user groups (Admin, Contributor, Viewer)
- S3 bucket for file attachments
Follow least privilege principle for all IAM policies.
```

### Step 4: Lambda Functions with Role-Based Logic
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create Lambda functions for task management with role-based access:
- getTasks: Filter results based on user role
- createTask: Allow Contributors and Admins
- updateTask: Allow only task owner or Admin
- deleteTask: Admin only
Include proper error handling and input validation.
```

## Phase 3: Policy Validation and Security Testing

### Step 5: Policy Extraction and Analysis
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create a Node.js script that:
- Runs 'cdk synth' to generate CloudFormation
- Extracts all IAM policies from the template
- Saves policies to separate JSON files for analysis
- Identifies overly permissive policies
```

### Step 6: AWS Access Analyzer Integration
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create a Python GUI application using tkinter that:
- Loads IAM policy JSON files
- Validates policies using AWS Access Analyzer API
- Displays findings with severity levels
- Suggests policy improvements
- Exports validation reports
```

## Phase 4: Frontend with Secure Authentication

### Step 7: React App with Cognito Integration
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create a React TypeScript application with:
- AWS Amplify authentication
- Role-based component rendering
- Task CRUD operations with proper error handling
- File upload to S3 with presigned URLs
- Responsive design with role-specific navigation
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

### Step 8: Security Testing
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create comprehensive security tests for the task manager:
- Unit tests for Lambda authorizer logic
- Integration tests for role-based API access
- Policy validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Penetration testing scenarios for each user role
```

### Step 9: Deployment Pipeline
**Amazon Q Prompt:**
```
Create a deployment pipeline that:
- Validates IAM policies before deployment
- Runs security tests
- Deploys infrastructure with CDK
- Configures Cognito user groups
- Sets up monitoring and alerting
```
