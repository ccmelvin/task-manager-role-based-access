# Building a Serverless Task Manager with RBAC on AWS
## An end-to-end guide to secure, scalable task management using Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB

Managing tasks efficiently while maintaining proper security controls is crucial for any organization. I recently built a comprehensive task management system that leverages AWS serverless technologies and implements robust role-based access control (RBAC). Here's how I architected and implemented this system.

## The Challenge

Traditional task management systems struggle with:
- **Scalability bottlenecks**: Monolithic architectures that can't handle variable loads
- **Complex permission management**: Hard-coded roles that don't scale with organizational changes
- **High infrastructure costs**: Always-on servers with unpredictable utilization
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Inadequate access control and token management

I wanted to create a solution that addresses these challenges while providing enterprise-grade security and a modern developer experience.

## Architecture Overview

This architecture takes a serverless-first approach, utilizing AWS managed services for scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness:

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript and AWS Amplify authentication
- **API Layer**: API Gateway with custom Lambda authorizer for JWT validation
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda functions with hexagonal architecture pattern
- **Database**: DynamoDB with optimized GSIs for role-based queries
- **Storage**: S3 for secure file attachments
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito with user groups
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for reproducible deployments

### API Gateway Configuration

```typescript
const api = new RestApi(this, 'TaskManagerAPI', {
  restApiName: 'Task Manager Service',
  defaultCorsPreflightOptions: {
    allowOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://yourdomain.com'],
    allowMethods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  },
  deployOptions: {
    throttle: {
      rateLimit: 1000,
      burstLimit: 2000,
    },
    loggingLevel: MethodLoggingLevel.INFO,
  },
});
```

## Role-Based Access Control Implementation

The RBAC system implements three distinct user roles with fine-grained permissions:

### User Roles

The system implements three distinct user roles with clearly defined permissions:

**Admin**
- ✅ Full CRUD operations on all tasks
- ✅ User management and role assignment
- ✅ System configuration access
- ✅ Complete visibility across all projects
- ✅ Delete any task

**Contributor**
- ✅ Create new tasks
- ✅ Edit tasks they created or are assigned to
- ✅ View all tasks they created or are assigned to
- ✅ Upload and manage file attachments
- ❌ Cannot delete tasks
- ❌ Cannot access other users' tasks

**Viewer**
- ✅ Read-only access to tasks assigned to them
- ✅ View task details and attachments
- ❌ Cannot create, edit, or delete tasks
- ❌ Cannot access unassigned tasks
- ❌ Cannot upload attachments

### Custom Lambda Authorizer

The authorizer validates JWT tokens and generates dynamic IAM policies:

```typescript
export const authorizerHandler = async (
  event: APIGatewayTokenAuthorizerEvent
): Promise<APIGatewayAuthorizerResult> => {
  try {
    const token = extractToken(event.authorizationToken);
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, await getJWTSecret()) as JWTPayload;
    
    const userId = decoded.sub;
    const userGroups = decoded['cognito:groups'] || [];
    const userRole = determineUserRole(userGroups);
    
    const policy = generateIAMPolicy(userId, userRole, event.methodArn);
    
    return {
      principalId: userId,
      policyDocument: policy,
      context: { userId, userRole, email: decoded.email },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  }
};
```

### Resource-Level Authorization

Beyond API-level authorization, each Lambda function implements resource-level checks:

```typescript
export class TaskAuthorizationService {
  async authorizeTaskAccess(
    taskId: string, 
    userId: string, 
    userRole: UserRole, 
    operation: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete'
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    if (userRole === 'Admin') return true;
    
    const task = await this.taskRepository.findById(taskId);
    if (!task) throw new NotFoundError('Task not found');
    
    switch (operation) {
      case 'read':
        return userRole === 'Contributor' 
          ? (task.createdBy === userId || task.assignedTo === userId)
          : task.assignedTo === userId; // Viewer
      case 'write':
        return userRole === 'Contributor' && 
               (task.createdBy === userId || task.assignedTo === userId);
      case 'delete':
        return false; // Only admins can delete
    }
  }
}
```

## Database Design

DynamoDB schema optimized for role-based access patterns:

```typescript
const tasksTable = new Table(this, 'TasksTable', {
  partitionKey: { name: 'taskId', type: AttributeType.STRING },
  billingMode: BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
});

// GSI for querying tasks by assignee
tasksTable.addGlobalSecondaryIndex({
  indexName: 'AssignedToIndex',
  partitionKey: { name: 'assignedTo', type: AttributeType.STRING },
  sortKey: { name: 'createdAt', type: AttributeType.STRING },
});

// GSI for querying tasks by creator
tasksTable.addGlobalSecondaryIndex({
  indexName: 'CreatedByIndex',
  partitionKey: { name: 'createdBy', type: AttributeType.STRING },
  sortKey: { name: 'deadline', type: AttributeType.STRING },
});
```

### Efficient Data Access

```typescript
async findTasksByRole(userId: string, role: UserRole): Promise<Task[]> {
  const queries: Promise<Task[]>[] = [];

  switch (role) {
    case 'Admin':
      queries.push(this.scanAllTasks());
      break;
    case 'Contributor':
      queries.push(
        this.queryTasksByIndex('CreatedByIndex', 'createdBy', userId),
        this.queryTasksByIndex('AssignedToIndex', 'assignedTo', userId)
      );
      break;
    case 'Viewer':
      queries.push(
        this.queryTasksByIndex('AssignedToIndex', 'assignedTo', userId)
      );
      break;
  }

  const results = await Promise.all(queries);
  return this.deduplicateAndSort(results.flat());
}
```

## Security Implementation

### JWT Token Validation

```typescript
export class JWTValidator {
  async validateToken(token: string): Promise<JWTPayload> {
    const decoded = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true }) as any;
    const key = await this.getSigningKey(decoded.header.kid);
    
    const payload = jwt.verify(token, key, {
      algorithms: ['RS256'],
      issuer: process.env.COGNITO_ISSUER,
      audience: process.env.COGNITO_CLIENT_ID,
    }) as JWTPayload;

    await this.validateCustomClaims(payload);
    return payload;
  }

  private async validateCustomClaims(payload: JWTPayload): Promise<void> {
    // Validate token age
    const tokenAge = Date.now() / 1000 - payload.iat;
    if (tokenAge > 86400) throw new Error('Token too old');

    // Validate user status and group membership
    const userStatus = await this.getUserStatus(payload.sub);
    if (userStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') throw new Error('User not confirmed');
    
    const groups = payload['cognito:groups'] || [];
    if (groups.length === 0) throw new Error('No assigned groups');
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting

```typescript
export class RateLimiter {
  private limits = {
    perUser: { requests: 100, window: 60 },
    perIP: { requests: 1000, window: 60 },
  };

  async checkRateLimit(userId: string, ipAddress: string) {
    const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    const windowStart = now - (now % this.limits.perUser.window);

    const userKey = `rate:user:${userId}:${windowStart}`;
    const ipKey = `rate:ip:${ipAddress}:${windowStart}`;

    const [userCount, ipCount] = await Promise.all([
      this.redis.incr(userKey),
      this.redis.incr(ipKey),
    ]);

    if (userCount > this.limits.perUser.requests || 
        ipCount > this.limits.perIP.requests) {
      return { allowed: false, remaining: 0 };
    }

    return { 
      allowed: true, 
      remaining: this.limits.perUser.requests - userCount 
    };
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
export class CachedTaskService {
  async getTasksByUser(userId: string, userRole: UserRole): Promise<Task[]> {
    const cacheKey = `user:${userId}:tasks:${userRole}`;
    
    // Try cache first
    const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
    
    // Fetch from database
    const tasks = await this.taskRepository.findTasksByRole(userId, userRole);
    
    // Cache with appropriate TTL
    await this.redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(tasks));
    return tasks;
  }
}
```

### Lambda Optimization

```typescript
// Connection pooling outside handler
const dynamoClient = new DynamoDBClient({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
  maxAttempts: 3,
  retryMode: 'adaptive',
});

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
  // Reuse connections across invocations
  const taskService = new TaskService(dynamoClient);
  return await taskService.handleRequest(event);
};
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Structured Logging

```typescript
export const handler = tracer.captureLambdaHandler(
  logger.injectLambdaContext(
    metrics.logMetrics(async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent) => {
      const segment = tracer.getSegment();
      segment?.addAnnotation('userId', event.requestContext.authorizer?.userId);
      segment?.addAnnotation('operation', event.httpMethod);

      try {
        const result = await processRequest(event);
        metrics.addMetric('RequestSuccess', MetricUnits.Count, 1);
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        metrics.addMetric('RequestError', MetricUnits.Count, 1);
        logger.error('Request failed', { error: error.message });
        throw error;
      }
    })
  )
);
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Security by Design
Implementing RBAC from the beginning is much easier than retrofitting it later. Design your data access patterns around your permission model from day one.

### 2. Embrace Serverless Constraints
Lambda's execution limits forced me to write more efficient, focused functions. This constraint actually resulted in better overall architecture.

### 3. Type Safety Across the Stack
TypeScript throughout the entire stack caught numerous bugs during development and made refactoring much safer. The shared type definitions between frontend and backend eliminated API contract mismatches.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code is Essential
AWS CDK made it easy to maintain consistent environments and enabled rapid iteration. The ability to version control infrastructure changes was invaluable.

### 5. Observability from Day One
Implementing comprehensive logging, tracing, and metrics from the start made debugging and optimization much easier than adding them later.

## Performance Results

The final system achieves impressive performance metrics, measured using AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray distributed tracing, and custom application metrics:

- **Sub-100ms API response times** for cached requests (measured via CloudWatch API Gateway latency metrics)
- **Auto-scaling from 0 to 1000+ concurrent users** (validated through load testing with Artillery.js)
- **99.9% availability** with built-in AWS service redundancy (tracked via CloudWatch uptime monitoring)
- **<$50/month operating costs** for typical small-medium team usage (monitored through AWS Cost Explorer)
- **Zero infrastructure maintenance** required (inherent benefit of serverless architecture)

Performance monitoring is implemented through:
- **AWS X-Ray**: End-to-end request tracing across all services
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: API Gateway latency, Lambda duration, DynamoDB performance
- **Custom Application Metrics**: Business-specific KPIs like task creation rates and user activity
