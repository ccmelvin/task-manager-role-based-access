# Deployment and CI/CD Rules for Amazon Q

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **Tests Workflow** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`): Automated testing on push/PR
- **Validate and Deploy** (`.github/workflows/validate-and-deploy.yml`): CDK deployment
- Multi-stage pipeline with proper gates and approvals

### Testing Pipeline
- **Matrix Testing**: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **Test Categories**: AWS integration, CLI end-to-end, GUI tests
- **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov integration
- **Artifact Upload**: Test results and coverage reports

## Deployment Environments

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Feature branch deployments
- **Staging**: Main branch automatic deployment
- **Production**: Manual approval required
- **Testing**: Isolated environment for test execution

### CDK Deployment Best Practices
- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper stack naming conventions
- Use CDK context for environment variables
- Implement cross-stack references properly
- Use CDK aspects for consistent tagging

## Infrastructure as Code

### CDK Structure
- **Stacks**: Organized by service boundaries
- **Constructs**: Reusable components
- **Aspects**: Cross-cutting concerns (tagging, security)
- **Context**: Environment-specific configuration

### Resource Management
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper resource tagging
- Use removal policies appropriately
- Implement backup strategies for stateful resources
- Monitor resource costs and usage

## Security in CI/CD

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least privilege for CI/CD roles
- Implement secret scanning in pipelines
- Use AWS IAM roles for GitHub Actions

### Security Scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable packages
- **Code Scanning**: Static analysis with bandit
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: CDK security checks
- **Container Scanning**: If using containers
- **License Compliance**: Check for license issues

## Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Checks
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage thresholds met
- Security scans pass
- Linting and formatting checks pass
- Manual approval for production

### Post-deployment Validation
- Health checks pass
- Smoke tests execute successfully
- Monitoring alerts configured
- Performance benchmarks met
- Rollback procedures tested

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- X-Ray tracing for distributed systems
- Custom metrics for business logic
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Error tracking and alerting

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Resource utilization metrics
- Cost monitoring and alerts
- Security compliance monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Availability monitoring

## Rollback and Recovery

### Rollback Strategies
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Canary deployments for gradual rollout
- Feature flags for quick disabling
- Database migration rollback procedures
- Infrastructure rollback with CDK

### Disaster Recovery
- Regular backup testing
- Cross-region replication setup
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) defined
- Recovery point objectives (RPO) defined
- Disaster recovery runbooks maintained

## Performance and Optimization

### Build Optimization
- Cache dependencies between builds
- Parallel test execution
- Incremental builds where possible
- Artifact reuse across stages
- Build time monitoring and optimization

### Deployment Optimization
- Minimize deployment time
- Use CDK hotswap for development
- Implement proper health checks
- Use deployment slots where available
- Monitor deployment success rates

## Documentation and Communication

### Deployment Documentation
- Maintain deployment runbooks
- Document rollback procedures
- Keep architecture diagrams updated
- Document configuration changes
- Maintain troubleshooting guides

### Communication
- Notify stakeholders of deployments
- Maintain deployment calendars
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Share post-mortem findings
- Communicate maintenance windows

## Compliance and Governance

### Change Management
- All changes through version control
- Peer review requirements
- Approval workflows for production
- Change documentation requirements
- Audit trail maintenance

### Compliance Requirements
- Data retention policies
- Security compliance checks
- Regulatory requirement validation
- Access control auditing
- Configuration drift detection
